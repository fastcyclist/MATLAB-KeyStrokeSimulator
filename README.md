# MATLAB-KeyStrokeSimulator

It types as if you're typing. 

There are 2 files. You need to choose 1 of them that suits better.
`Shift.m` presses the shift key once a minute for 8 hrs.
`TheShining.m` types 'All work and no play make Jack a dull boy.' for 8 hours.
As the name implies, this was motivated by [The Shining](https://youtu.be/4lQ_MjU4QHw) 

If you don't have MATLAB, you can download the exe file and run it.
If you're using `TheShining.m`, make sure you have notepad or MS-Word ready.

## Prerequisites

MATLAB - any version will do.
If you don't have MATLAB, download exe files from here and also get [MATLAB Runtime](https://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/matlab-runtime.html). The MATLAB runtime lets you run a compiled MATLAB code without a lincese.
`Shift.exe` and `TheShining.exe` were compiled using `R2015a(8.5)`, so download that one from the website.
